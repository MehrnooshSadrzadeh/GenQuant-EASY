\section{Type-Logical Syntax}

Following the terminology and notation of Barwise and  Perry, given a phrase containing a quantifier followed by a noun, that is `Q noun', we call `Q' a determiner and the phrase `Q noun' a quantified  phrase.Hence,  a quantified phrase is a noun phrase which is created by the application of a determiner to a noun phrase.  The type of the determiner is as follows, where $n$ is the atomic type assigned to a noun phrase:
\[
n n^l
\]
The  type-reductions of a sentence with a quantified noun phrase as its  subject is as follows:

\begin{center}
{\bf Quantified Subject}\qquad  \tikzfig{Q-trans-sbj-syn} 
\end{center}

The case of a quantified object is identically done.
