Relational interpretation of Frobenius and the compact structure. Also
the isomorphisms $1 \to X\x Y // X \to Y // X \x Y \to 1$.

Intended interpretation of $\Det$ and the need for matching types :
Powerset lifting as a lifting of a monad to the Kleisli category of a
monad, because $\Rel$ is $\Set_\wp$ and we have $\lambda : \wp\wp
\Rightarrow \wp\wp$ defined by (example) $\{\{1,3,4\},\{7,2}\} \mapsto
\{\{1,7\},\{1,2\},\{3,7\},\{3,2\},\{4,7\},\{4,2\}\}$ really? Check
this. 

Example: lifted frobenius

Examples of determiners: exists, all, some, two





%For this part, we work in the category $Rel$ of sets and relations. This is compact closed as follows \cite{BobEric}. 
%
%Take $N$ to be a vector space with a fixed basis ${\cal B}$, where ${\cal B}$ is a finite set. A  basis vector of $N$  is denoted by $\ov{n}_i$. Given a set of individuals ${\cal U}$,  each  individual is mapped to a basis vector of $N$, the map is denoted by $\pi \colon {\cal U} \to {\cal B}$.  Thus a subset of basis vectors of $N$ represents a subset of individuals.  For example,    the sum $\sum_i \ov{n}_i$ denotes the `men' subset of individuals, where $i$ ranges over the basis vectors that are mappings of the individuals that are men. 
%
%Take $S$ to be the one dimensional space free over the singleton $\ov{1}$. The  zero vector represents false, and any nonzero value represents a degree of truth. 
%
%A transitive verb $w$, which is a vector in the space $N \otimes S
%\otimes N$, is represented by 
%\[
%\ov{w} := \sum_{ij} \ov{\{{n}\}}_i \otimes \ov{1}  \otimes \ov{\{n\}}_j, \quad 
%\text{if} \  \pi^{-1}({n}_i) \ w\mbox{'s} \  \pi^{-1}({n}_j)
%\]
% For example, the verb ``stroke'', denoted by $\ov{stroke}$, is represented by $
%\sum_{(i,j) \in  R_{stroke}} \ov{\{n\}}_i \otimes  \ov{1}
%\otimes \ov{\{n\}}_j$, for  $R_{stroke}$  the set of all pairs $(i,j)$ such that $\pi^{-1}(\ov{n}_i)$ strokes $\pi^{-1}(\ov{n}_j)$.  An intransitive verb ``sneeze'', denoted by $\ov{sneeze}$, is represented by $\sum_{i \in R_{sleep}} \ov{\{n\}}_i \otimes \ov{1}$, such that $\pi^{-1}(\ov{n}_i)$ sneezes.  
%
%
%The meaning of the sentence ``Det Sbj Verb''is a vector obtained by computing the following, which corresponds to the categorical morphism of the normalised diagram of the sentence.  
%
%\[
%(\epsilon_N \otimes 1_S) \circ (Det \otimes  \mu_N \otimes 1_S) \circ (\delta_N \otimes 1_{N \otimes S})\Big(\ov{Sbj} \otimes \ov{Verb}\Big)
%\]
%This is computed in three steps. First we compute the following
%
%\begin{align*}
%(\delta_N \otimes 1_{N \otimes S})\Big(\ov{Sbj} \otimes \ov{Verb}\Big) = 
%(\delta_N \otimes 1_{N \otimes S})\Big((\sum_i \ov{n}_i) \otimes (\sum_j \ov{n}_j  \otimes \ov{1}) \Big) =\\
%\delta_N(\sum_i \ov{n}_i) \otimes (\sum_j \ov{n}_j \otimes \ov{1}) = (\sum_i \ov{n}_i \otimes \ov{n}_i) \otimes (\sum_j \ov{n}_j \otimes \ov{1})
%\end{align*}
%
%\noindent
%Then we proceed by
%
%\begin{align*}
%(Det \otimes  \mu_N \otimes 1_S)\Big(\sum_i \ov{n}_i \otimes \ov{n}_i) \otimes (\sum_j \ov{n}_j \otimes \ov{1}\Big) = \\
%Det(\sum_i \ov{n}_i) \otimes  \mu_N(\sum_i \sum_j \ov{n}_i \otimes \ov{n}_j) \otimes 1_S(\ov{1}) = \\
%Det(\sum_i \ov{n}_i) \otimes  (\sum_i \sigma_{ij} \ov{n}_i) \otimes \ov{1} 
%\end{align*}
%
%\noindent
%The final step is as follows:
%
%\begin{align*}
%(\epsilon_{N} \otimes 1_S)  \Big(Det(\sum_i \ov{n}_i) \otimes (\sum_i \sigma_{ij} \ov{n}_i) \otimes \ov{1} \Big) =   \langle \ov{w}_k \mid \ov{\{\sum_i \ov{n}_i\}} \rangle  \otimes \ov{1}
%\end{align*}
%
%\noindent 
%where $Det (\sum_i \ov{n}_i) = \sum_k \ov{w}_k$, for $w_k \subseteq B_N$ where $B_N$ is the set of basis vectors of $N$.  Meanings of sentences with quantified objects and transitive verbs are computed in an identical fashion. 
%
%
%
%
%As an example suppose we have  a set of men $\{m_1, m_2\}$ and a set of cats $\{c_1, c_2\}$. Now suppose that one of the men $m_1$ and all of the cats  sleep, that is we have
%\[
%\ov{sleep} \ = \  \ov{m}_1 \otimes \ov{1} + \ov{c}_1 \otimes \ov{1} + \ov{c}_2 \otimes \ov{1}
%\]
%Here are some sample sentences:
%\begin{enumerate}
%\item The meaning  of the sentence `some men sleep', is computed in three steps. In the first step, we obtain
%\[
%(\ov{m}_1 \otimes \ov{m}_1 + \ov{m}_2 \otimes \ov{m}_2)  \otimes ( \ov{m}_1 \otimes \ov{1} + \ov{c}_1 \otimes \ov{1} + \ov{c}_2 \otimes \ov{1})
%\]
%In the second step we obtain
%\[
%Some(\ov{m}_1 + \ov{m}_2) \otimes {\cal P}(\ov{m}_1) \otimes \ov{1} = 
%(\ov{\{\ov{m}_1\}} + \ov{\{\ov{m}_2\}} + \ov{\{\ov{m}_1, \ov{m}_2\}}) \otimes (\ov{\{\ov{m}_1\}}) \otimes \ov{1}
% \]
%In the last step we obtain $\ov{1}$, since we have $\left \langle \ov{\{\ov{m}_1\}} \mid \ov{\{\ov{m}_1\}}) \right \rangle = 1$. This  means that the meaning of this sentence is true.  
%\item The meaning of `all men sleep' would be false. Since, in this case, in the second step we would obtain
%\[
%All(\ov{m}_1 + \ov{m}_2) \otimes {\cal P}(\ov{m}_1) \otimes \ov{1} = 
%(\ov{\{\ov{m}_1, \ov{m}_2\}}) \otimes (\ov{\{\ov{m}_1\}}) \otimes \ov{1}
% \]
%which would result to a 0 in the third step, since $\left \langle \ov{\{\ov{m}_1, \ov{m}_2\}} \mid \ov{\{\ov{m}_1\}}) \right \rangle = 0$.  
%\item The sentence `half of  men sleep' would also be true, since in the second step we obtain
%\[
%Half(\ov{m}_1 + \ov{m}_2) \otimes {\cal P}(\ov{m}_1) \otimes \ov{1} = 
%(\ov{\{\ov{m}_1\}} + \ov{\{\ov{m}_2\}}) \otimes (\ov{\{\ov{m}_1\}}) \otimes \ov{1}
% \]
%since we  have $\left \langle \ov{\{\ov{m}_1\}} \mid \ov{\{\ov{m}_1\}}) \right \rangle = 1$, in the third step we will obtain a $\ov{1}$.  
%\item The sentence `no man sleeps' will be false, since in the second step we obtain
%\[
%No(\ov{m}_1 + \ov{m}_2) \otimes {\cal P}(\ov{m}_1) \otimes \ov{1} = 
%(\ov{\{ \ \}}) \otimes (\ov{\{\ov{m}_1\}}) \otimes \ov{1}
% \]
% This, in the third step,  will results in $\left \langle \ov{\{\ \}} \mid \ov{\{\ov{m}_1\}}) \right \rangle = 0$.
