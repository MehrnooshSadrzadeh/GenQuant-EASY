We have not done the necessary expositions here, but as shown in \cite{CoeckePaquettePavlovic09,CoeckePaq},  the Frobenius $ \mu$ map is the analog of  set-theoretic intersection and the compact closed  epsilon map is the analog of  set-theoretic application. Using these it is not hard to show that  this truth-theoretic interpretation of the compact closed semantics of quantified sentences provides us with the same meaning as their generalised quantifier semantics.

\begin{proposition}
The truth-theoretic interpretation of the compact closed semantics of quantified sentences provides us with the same meaning as their generalised quantifier semantics.
